"My graduation project, 'Mudawah' (Healing), is a comprehensive Android application designed to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers. The system enables users to locate highly-rated doctors, clinics, and hospitals, manage bookings, and share verified experience reviews to improve healthcare transparency.

Key Technical Contributions:


Frontend Development: Built using Flutter and Dart to ensure a high-performance, responsive user interface across Android devices.


Backend & Data Management: Developed a robust backend using PHP and MySQL to handle relational data, including complex queries for doctor ratings, user reviews, and real-time appointment availability.


Feature Integration: Implemented a rating and review algorithm that processes user feedback to dynamically rank healthcare providers, ensuring data integrity and a trust-based ecosystem.


Performance: Achieved a near-perfect grade of 4.80/5.00 by demonstrating efficient data synchronization between the mobile client and the server-side database.
